* elfeed-webkit.el

Render [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][elfeed]] entries in embedded webkit widgets.

Many feeds render well as text, some don't. Or maybe you're interested
in a feed entry's dynamic content that doesn't get rendered into the
feed at all (think comments). Elfeed provides =b= for this case, which
opens an entry's link in the browser. If you'd rather stay in Emacs
and not lose the context of elfeed and its key bindings, this package
allows you to render an entry's link in an embedded webkit widget.

Webkit rendering can be toggled on/off manually, or automatically
based on an entry's tags.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =elfeed-webkit.el=, put it in
your =load-path= and =require= it.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-webkit
  :ensure
  :after elfeed)
#+end_src

* Requirements

Your Emacs needs to have been compiled with support for xwidgets. Try
=(featurep 'xwidget-internal)= if you're unsure.

* Usage and customization Options
** Toggle manually

Use =M-x elfeed-webkit-toggle= to toggle webkit on/off in an elfeed
entry buffer. It is recommended to bind that command to a convenient
key in =elfeed-show-mode-map=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-webkit
  :ensure
  :bind (:map elfeed-show-mode-map
              ("t" . elfeed-webkit-toggle)))
#+end_src

** Enable based on entry tags

Elfeed entries can also be rendered with webkit automatically, based
on the entry's tags. This can be useful if you know that a specific
feed /never/ renders well in text. See elfeed's [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed/tree/master#autotagging][autotagging feature]] for
how to apply tags to all entries of a given feed.

To set up automatic rendering with webkit, run
=elfeed-webkit-auto-enable-by-tag=.

By default, entries with either a =wk= or =webkit= tag will be affected.
The list of tags that triggers webkit is customizable via
=elfeed-webkit-auto-tags=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package elfeed-webkit
  :ensure
  :demand ;; !
  :init
  (setq elfeed-webkit-auto-tags '(webkit comics))
  :config
  (elfeed-webkit-auto-enable-by-tag)
  :bind (:map elfeed-show-mode-map
              ("t" . elfeed-webkit-toggle)))
#+end_src

* Keys

In a gist, =elfeed-webkit= uses the default keys available in elfeed
entry buffers, then layers the xwidget webkit keys on top with a
select few customizations.

Here are some of the more commonly used keys:

| Key | Function                                   |
|-----+--------------------------------------------|
| =n= | show next item in elfeed search buffer     |
| =p= | show previous item in elfeed search buffer |
| =u= | mark current entry unread                  |
| =+= | add tag(s) to displayed entry              |
| =-= | remove tag(s) from displayed entry         |
| =g= | refresh displayed entry                    |
| =b= | go back in webkit's browsing history       |
| =f= | go forward                                 |
| =v= | visit current webkit URL in a browser      |
| =y= | yank current webkit URL                    |

As always, use =C-h b= to display all defined keys in a buffer.

- I start out on the =*elfeed-search*= buffer with a few [[https://irreal.org/blog/][Irreal blog posts]], and with webkit rendering disabled.
- I press =RET= to open the selected entry "/Completing Org Links/"; it renders as text.
- I press =t= to toggle on webkit rendering, then =t= one more time to toggle it off again.
- I press =n= to go to the next entry, "/Moving to Elfeed/"; it renders as text.
- I press =n= to go to the next entry, "/Captee/": this entry has the =webkit= tag mentioned before, and automatically renders with webkit as a result.
- I press =q= to quit out to =*elfeed-search*=.
